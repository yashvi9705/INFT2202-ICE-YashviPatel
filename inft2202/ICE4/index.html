			<div id="excerpt">
				<p id="speckled-excerpt">
					"The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a
					high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws
					of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings
					the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards,
					while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The
					central portion was in little better repair, but the
					right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in
					the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the
					chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.
					Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and
					the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs
					of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked
					slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with
					deep attention the outsides of the windows.""
